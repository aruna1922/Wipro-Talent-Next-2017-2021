Create a new class called “Calculator” which contains the following: 
1. A static method called powerInt(int num1,int num2) that accepts two integers and returns 
num1 to the power of num2 (num1 power num2). 
2. A static method called powerDouble(double num1,int num2) that accepts one double and one 
integer and returns num1 to the power of num2 (num1 power num2). 
3. Call your method from another class without instantiating the class (i.e. call it like 
Calculator.powerInt(12,10) since your methods are defined to be static)


import java.lang.Math;
public class Calci
{
    public static int powerInt(int n1, int n2) {
        return(int) Math.pow(n1, n2);
    }
    public static double powerDouble(double n1, double n2) {
        return Math.pow(n1, n2);
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(Calci.powerInt(12, 2));
        System.out.println(Calci.powerDouble(1.5, 2));
    }
}
